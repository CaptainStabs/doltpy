## DoltPy
This is DoltPy, the Python API for Dolt. Python is the language of choice for data science and data engineering, and thus we thought it would be wise to publish an API for building automated workflows on top of Dolt. 

### Installation
We are yet to publish this API, but you can still use `pip` to install it. To use the distribution format:
```bash
$ pip install doltpy/dist/doltpy-0.1.tar.gz
```
Or use `pip` editable mode to install for local development:
```bash
$ pip install -e doltpy
```
Which will use `setup.py` to make the appropriate installation using a fresh build of the local copy of the source files.
